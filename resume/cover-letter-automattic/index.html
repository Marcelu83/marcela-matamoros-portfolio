          <h2>A cover letter for Matt Mullenweg and Automattic</h2>
            <h4>Hello Matt!<br>Hello Automatticians!
            </h4>
            <p>I believe this is one of the most candid cover letters I will ever write. Possibly one of the longest, as well.
I am aware that it may be better to keep it short (it's what everyone says), but it turns out to be quite difficult when it comes to something that makes me excited. When this happens, I can talk or write for hours.
              </p>
            <p>Some say that resumes talk about your past, while cover letters talk about your future. I agree partially with this statement, as I think sometimes people need to understand where you come from in order to connect the dots and then see why you would be an awesome addition to the company. I won't tell an elaborate story about how I got to where I am now, but if you see references to my past in here that's the why.
              </p>
            <p>After this long introduction, let me present myself: my name is Marcela, I am from Costa Rica and I have used WordPress.com as my platform of choice for self-expression since 2010, when I built my first blog. Though I am not as technically savvy as I would like to (yet), I am in my way to become more proficient through constant learning and experimentation. So, when I saw  there was an opening for a Happiness Engineering position at Automattic I knew it would be something I'd LOVE to do as it combines learning, communicating and helping people, any way possible.
              </p>
            <p>Perfecting communication through writing, helping others and learning new things every day have been driving forces during my whole life.  Not that I ain't passionate about other things, but when it comes to professional development these 3 skills have made all the difference in terms of my own happiness and most importantly, the happiness that I can give to the rest of the world.
              </p>

          <h4>My Customer Service Philosophy</h4>
            <p>I have to be very honest. I haven't read many books or blogs about customer service, at least not recently, since most of what I know about this topic comes from my own professional and personal experiences working at different customer support positions at Intel and HP. Though I had an idea of what good customer service was before this job, I certainly met a whole new universe when it was my turn of sitting at the helping side of the screen and assist employees in solving all type of problems. They could be as simple as changing the physical address of an employee in the system or as complex as following through a payroll problem that would impact the employee in terms of their benefits coverage or a wage garnishment; from problems that had scripted solutions to problems that had a greater deal of ambiguity around and which required coordination with other team members and subject experts to find a solution.
              </p>
            <p>Patience, grace and lots of empathy were required every time, as feelings were involved.  Like the time an employee had lost her husband and she broke down in tears on the phone as she had to discuss the details surrounding his beneficiaries. Being empathic and making people feel like people, rather than mere customers, is Pillar #1 of my support philosophy. I remember that in the case of this employee, I didn't have the solution in my hands as it was out of my scope, but being caring and understanding of her feelings provided her with a sense of having a friend trying to do as much as possible to help  rather than just saying "that's not for me to do".
              </p>
            <p>As the customer-facing part of a business, you have to know that canned responses or mechanical answers will not always fit a problem. That's Pillar #2 of my philosophy. I remember one specific case where this made the difference between a satisfactory experience and a lousy mess.
              </p>
            <p>The most important web-based training at Intel was the Code of Conduct, which was mandatory for the whole company (more than 100k employees) had 8 different versions as it was translated to multiple languages, and was a long and dense course overall. The Quality and Assurance process to ensure that the course worked perfectly well in the Learning Management System demanded at least 3 business days per courseware, since it was pretty detailed and methodic to avoid dozens of HR tickets coming in case of an error. The thing is there was an allusion to the CEO in one of the training's sections and by mid-year this CEO exited the company in the middle of inappropriate conduct allegations. The HR Legal team asked for help to update all the set of 8 courses in a matter of a day if possible. Initially, we thought about pushing the SLA, advising that our processes demanded more time, but given the urgency and the sensitivity of the content we couldn’t give them the standard response as the situation did not fit the mold. We ended up adjusting our priorities, setting up a contingency plan and taking a responsible risk by testing a sample of 3 courses and then uploading the rest if the first bundle worked fine. The whole process ended up well and in a matter of a day and a halfs everything was up and running. The folks from Legal were beyond happy with the outcome, so much that they even sent us recognitions!
              </p>
            <p>And finally, Pillar #3 is follow up and hold yourself accountable. I know it sounds obvious, but there nothing worse than needing help and seeing days go by without any news. You don’t need to have a solution right away, but if you treat the customer problem as if it was your own you will know that keeping in touch and offering updates in the meantime will contribute in building an awesome overall experience. Even if the problem is unsolved at the end, they will remember you as someone who tried their best and who treated them with the respect they deserve.
              </p>
            <p>Despite the fact that I haven’t read that much about the topic lately, I am confident that my experience and views of customer support can be of great value for Automattic, helping it strengthen its already strong culture.  In the meantime, I am starting to delve on Tony Hsieh's "Delivering Happiness", which was recommended to me by a friend who knows I want to refresh my knowledge.
            </p>

          <h4>Learning, always and forever</h4>
            <p>"I will never stop learning" is the first sentence of Automattic's creed and awesomely enough, it's  mine too. Really! I don't say this just for you to consider me for this position: if there is one thing I've done consistently during my entire life, that thing has been learning. About human nature. About the way people communicate and understand each other. About art. About books. About geography. About languages. About technology. About almost anything that sparks my interest. I have also learned to learn from my mistakes and do it better the second and third time around.
              </p>
            <p>Fortunately enough, self-learning has been the foundation for many of the opportunities I've had in life, especially those where I wasn't given a manual or playbook and I had to figure things out myself. That same skill is the one I apply every day when I don’t know something. That's what I am applying now that I am learning to code and to use WordPress in depth.
              </p>
            <p> So, summarizing this phrase means the following to me: Learning is the base for a successful career and life overall. You can do anything in the world as long as you are willing to learn, try, experiment, teach others and apply your learnings with a service purpose in mind.
              </p>

          <h4>Wrapping up…</h4>
            <p>I told you this was going to be a long letter, but I'm sure it has given you a glimpse of who I am, the value I can add to the Happiness Engineering Team and how I can help WordPress.com users.  Aside from this, I can also bring the following:
              </p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Fun:</b> my humor is kind of silly, but sure I can be fun to be around.</li>
              <li><b>A place for you to stay in Costa Rica:</b> I have a spare room and I love showing my country to other people.</li>
              <li><b>Honesty:</b> you can expect someone who speaks her mind (I am the worst liar ever), but who will always tell things in a respectful and constructive way.</li>
              <li><b>Hard work and accountability:</b> that's the way my mom raised me, all great things require work but they are so worth it!</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you want to know more about my professional experience, I invite you to review my<a href="../index.html"> resume</a> and contact me with all your questions. My <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcela-matamoros-43237b11/" target="blank">LinkedIn profile</a> also offers a comprehensive summary of my "jack-of-all-trades" career progression. Sounds weird, but I really enjoyed writing this letter. I hope it has been as fun for you to read as it was for me to write it.
              </p>
            <p>Hopefully, I will be the best fit for the Happiness Engineering team. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
              </p>
